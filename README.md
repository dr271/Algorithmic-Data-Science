We empirically demonstrate and analyse the comparative theoretical worst-case running times of measurement calculations (such as Jaccard's or Cosine Similarity) on corpora represented as a either a BOW or dense vector representation.

The compressed file containing the amazon, reuters, twitter, medline and wsj corpora is very large, hence not uploaded here, but can be provided on request.
